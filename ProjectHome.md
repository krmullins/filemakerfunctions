# FileMaker custom functions #
This is a collection of FileMaker functions created by a number of developers. Each developer has their own folder to maintain their own collection of functions. Please search the list of functions (using grep is the fastest) to find out if someone has already created something similar.

Over time, developers end up revising and updating their custom functions. This is a great way to keep those functions updated. A mailing list is used to send out notifications of update commits from any developer who has access to the repository.

This collection was started by Matt Petrowsky of http://www.filemakermagazine.com/

# Know when code is updated #
You'll want to [join the google group](http://groups.google.com/group/filemakerfunctions) if you want to be notified of committed changes to the functions.

# Other projects dealing with FileMaker #
Another project of interest to Mac based FileMaker developers, who also use an external text editor, is the TextMate bundle. You can find it here.
